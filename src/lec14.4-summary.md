## Summary

Stress is a tensor field that quantifies the pressure or tension exerted on a material object. In the context of hyperelastic materials, the **first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor** $\mathbf{P}$ plays a crucial role. It is defined as the derivative of the strain energy density function $\Psi$, with respect to the deformation gradient $\mathbf{F}$, establishing a **constitutive relationship** between stress and strain.

In practical computations, particularly for the **implicit integration of solid dynamics**, it is essential to compute $\mathbf{P}$ and its derivative $\frac{\partial \mathbf{P}}{\partial \mathbf{F}}$ efficiently. By leveraging the sparsity structure in diagonal space, these computations become more feasible. Here, differentiations are primarily required for $\Psi$ with respect to the principal stretches $\sigma_i$, which simplifies the calculation process.

In the upcoming lecture, we will apply these principles to an **inversion-free elasticity model**, which will be demonstrated through the [compressing square simulation](lec11.2-compress_square.md). This application will use the concepts discussed in this chapter to address complex real-world problems in solid mechanics.
