# Boundary Conditions and Frictional Contact

Until now, we've omitted the Dirichlet boundary conditions and frictional contact in both the strong and weak forms of the governing equations to keep the derivations concise and straightforward. However, as we learned in the Boundary Treatments chapter, this boundary information is crucial for accurately simulating a wide range of solid dynamics.
