## Summary

The objective of our discussions so far has been to devise a reliable solution for the unconditional stable implicit time integration problem. We aimed to address the issue of non-convergent solutions arising from truncation errors. We tackled this by reformulating the time integration problem as a minimization problem. This formulation not only allowed us to apply well-established optimization techniques, but it also facilitated a consistent modeling framework for different physical phenomena.

Here is a quick summary of the techniques used for modeling various phenomena within this framework:
- For conservative forces like gravity and elasticity, we used potential energies. These were integrated into the objective function to create an accurate representation of the forces involved.
- Boundary conditions, which specify the constraints on the system, were modeled using simple linear equality constraints. This helped us restrict the system to feasible states while performing the simulation.
- To prevent interpenetration between solid objects during the simulation, we used inequality constraints to model contact and friction. These constraints ensured that objects maintained their physical integrity and behaved as expected when they came in contact with each other.

An important aspect to note here is that, we can utilize the unique structure of the boundary conditions to enforce the equality constraints in an unconstrained way. This will lead to a significant reduction in computational complexity.

Moreover, we introduced the concept of the Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) method. The IPC method models contact and friction as smooth potential energies with a controllable level of accuracy. This ensures a robust and accurate simulation of solid objects, free from interpenetration.

Moving forward, in the next lecture, we will delve into the projected Newton method for solving unconstrained optimization problems. This method offers the advantage of global convergence, meaning that the method is guaranteed to converge regardless of the initial configuration, provided it is feasible. This feature is highly desirable for complex simulations and it helps make the method more robust and reliable.
