# Piecewise Linear Boundaries

In this lecture, we will continue our discussion on linear finite elements by focusing on boundary conditions and frictional self-contact on piecewise linear boundaries. Specifically, we will examine the computation of the boundary integral term:

$$
\int_{\partial\Omega^0} N_{\hat{a}}(\mathbf{X}) T_{\hat{i}}(\mathbf{X},t^n) \, ds(\mathbf{X})
{{numeq}}{eq:lec20:bi_disc_weak}
$$

We will cover this in the context of Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries, as well as normal and frictional self-contact forces.
