# Case Study: 2D Self-Contact*

We have finished connecting linear finite elements to the weak form derivation for elastodynamics and frictional contact. Now, it's time to see how these concepts are implemented in code. In this lecture, we will implement 2D frictionless self-contact based on our Python development of the inversion-free elasticity simulation from [Case Study: Inversion-free Elasticity](./lec15-inv_free_elasticity.md).

The executable Python project for this section can be found in <p style="color:red;">TODO: get a git org to host the code</p>

We will implement frictional self-contact in the next lecture.
