## Friction

3D friction is quite similar to its 2D counterpart, with the primary difference being the types of contact pairs involved. In 3D, these contact pairs are point-triangle and edge-edge pairs. Consequently, the barycentric coordinates of the closest points are now two-dimensional, represented by the optimal values of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ in the definitions provided in {{ref: def:lec24:pt_dist}} and {{ref: def:lec24:ee_dist}}.

In practice, this means that while the principles of friction remain the same, the specific calculations adjust to account for the geometry of the contact pairs in 3D space.
