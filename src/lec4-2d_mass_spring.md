# Case Study: 2D Mass Spring*

Up to now, we have completed a high-level introduction to the optimization-based solids simulation framework. In this lecture, we elaborate on how to implement a simple 2D elastodynamics simulator with <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python3</a> (CPU) and [MUDA](https://github.com/MuGdxy/muda) (GPU).

Sections in this book with Python CPU and MUDA GPU implementations will be marked with a * right after the title. 
All the Python and MUDA implementations can be found at [https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial](https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial) and [https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial-gpu](https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial-gpu), respectively.
The excutable project for this section is in the `/1_mass_spring` folder of these repositories.
