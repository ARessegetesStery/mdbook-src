# Case Study: 2D Mass Spring*

Up to now, we have completed a high-level introduction to the optimization-based solids simulation framework. In this lecture, we elaborate on how to implement a simple 2D elastodynamics simulator with <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python3</a>.

Sections in this book with Python implementations will be marked with a * right after the title. 
All the Python implementations can be found at ... <p style="color:red;">TODO: get a git org to host the code</p>
The excutable Python project for this section is in the `/1_mass_spring` folder of this repository.
