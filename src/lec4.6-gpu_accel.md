## GPU Accelerated Simulation
In this section, we extend the 2D mass-spring simulation example to leverage GPU acceleration using CUDA. This process involves porting our Python code to C++ with CUDA to achieve significant performance improvements for large-scale simulations. 
All the implementations can be found at [https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial-gpu](https://github.com/phys-sim-book/solid-sim-tutorial-gpu).
We utilize the Muda library to facilitate the GPU-accelerated simulation. Muda is a lightweight library that provides a simple interface for GPU-accelerated computations.Take a look at [https://github.com/MuGdxy/muda](https://github.com/MuGdxy/muda).
The excutable C++ project for this section is in the `simulators/1_mass_spring` folder of this repository.

The architecture of the GPU-accelerated simulator is similar to the Python version. All function and variable names are consistent with the Python version. However, the implementation details are different due to the GPU architecture and programming model.

### Key Considerations for GPU Performance
To fully utilize the performance of GPUs, there are two important aspects to consider:
- Exploiting Parallelism: GPUs excel at parallel computations. However, care must be taken to avoid read-write conflicts that can arise when multiple threads attempt to access the same memory locations simultaneously.
- Minimizing Data Transfer: In most current architectures, the CPU and GPU have separate memory spaces. Transferring data between these spaces can be costly in terms of performance. Therefore, it is essential to minimize data transfers between the CPU and GPU.

### Parallel Computations
In our implementation, parallelism is primarily employed in the computation of energy and its derivatives, as well as vector addition and subtraction. Let's take the MassSpringEnergy computation as an example. 

#### Energy Computation
The ParallelFor function distributes the computation across multiple GPU threads. The captured variables in the lambda function allow access to the necessary data structures within each thread.

{{imp}}{imp:lec4:MassSpringEnergyVal}[MassSpringEnergy.cu]
```cpp
{{#include solid-sim-tutorial-gpu/simulators/1_mass_spring/src/MassSpringEnergy.cu:val}}
```

#### Gradient Computation
The atomicAdd function is crucial in the gradient computation to ensure safe concurrent updates to shared data (different edges can update the gradient of the same node), thus preventing race conditions.

{{imp}}{imp:lec4:MassSpringEnergyGrad}[MassSpringEnergy.cu]
```cpp
{{#include solid-sim-tutorial-gpu/simulators/1_mass_spring/src/MassSpringEnergy.cu:grad}}
```
#### Hessian Computation
We utilized the Sparse Matrix data structure to store the Hessian matrix. The computation is parallelized across multiple threads, with each thread updating a specific element of the Hessian matrix. The main consideration here is to calculate the correct indices for each element.

{{imp}}{imp:lec4:MassSpringEnergyHess}[MassSpringEnergy.cu]
```cpp
{{#include solid-sim-tutorial-gpu/simulators/1_mass_spring/src/MassSpringEnergy.cu:hess}}
```
### Minimizing Data Transfer
To reduce data transfer between the CPU and GPU, we store the main energy values and their derivatives in GPU memory. Computations are performed directly on the GPU, and only the necessary position information is transferred back to the CPU for control and rendering. A more efficient implementation could render directly on the GPU, eliminating even this data transfer, but for simplicity and readability, we have not implemented that here.
{{imp}}{imp:lec4:energy_definition}[MassSpringEnergy.cu]
```cpp
{{#include solid-sim-tutorial-gpu/simulators/1_mass_spring/src/MassSpringEnergy.cu:definition}}
```
As shown in the code above, the energy values and their derivatives are stored in a "DeviceBuffer" object, which is a wrapper around the CUDA device memory implemented by the Muda library. This allows us to perform computations directly on the GPU without the need for data transfer between the CPU and GPU.

### Newton's Method Iteration
The primary iteration of Newton's method is a serial process and cannot be parallelized. Therefore, this part of the code is controlled by the CPU.

{{imp}}{imp:lec4:gpu_time_integrator}[simulator.cu]
```cpp
{{#include solid-sim-tutorial-gpu/simulators/1_mass_spring/src/simulator.cu:step_forward}}
```
In this function, step_forward implements the Newton method with line search, performing necessary computations on the GPU while controlling the process from the CPU.

### Conclusion
By leveraging CUDA for parallel computations and minimizing data transfer between the CPU and GPU, our GPU-accelerated version of the mass-spring simulation achieves significant performance improvements. This approach is crucial for handling large-scale simulations in elastodynamics and other computational physics applications.
