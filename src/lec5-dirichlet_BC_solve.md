# Dirichlet Boundary Conditions*

Boundary treatments, including boundary conditions and frictional contacts, play a crucial role in solid simulations. They not only enhance the expressiveness of scene setup but also capture intricate dynamics within the simulation. This lecture introduces Dirichlet boundary conditions, a pivotal concept for prescribing the motion of specific nodes in solid structures. Understanding these conditions is essential for accurately modeling and manipulating the behavior of solids in various simulation scenarios.
